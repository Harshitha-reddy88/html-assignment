           Ruskin Bond used to spend his summer at his grandmother’s house in Dehradun.
           While taking the train, he always had to pass through a small station called Deoli. No one used to get down at the station and nothing happened there.
           Until one day he sees a girl selling fruit and he is unable to forget her.
           Jack’s mother can make paper animals come to life.
           In the beginning, Jack loves them and spends hours with his mom. But as soon as he grows up, he stops talking to her since she is unable to speak in English.
           When his mother tries to talk to him through her creations, he kills them and collects them in a box.
           After a tragic loss, he finally gets to know her story through a hidden message that he should have read a long time ago.
           What Is Great About It: The story is a simple narration that touches on complex issues. It is about leaving your own country with the promise of a better life.
           It is also about the conflicts that can occur between families when different cultures and languages collide. In this case, the tension is so high 
           that it destroys the relationship between a mother and her son.

It also has a moving message about never taking your loved ones for granted.

       <h3>Earth has been destroyed by war and no one lives on it anymore.
           The robots and the machines continue to function and serve human beings who have long ago died. 
           What Is Great About It: The title is taken from a poem that describes how nature will continue its work long after humanity is gone.
           But in this story, we see that nature plays a supporting role and the machines are the ones who have taken its place.
           They continue their work without any human or natural assistance. This shows how technology has replaced nature 
           in our lives and how it can both destroy us and carry on without humanity itself.This is a humorous story where 
           the speaker explains the office policies, as well as gossip about the staff, to a new employee.
           It is extremely easy to read as the sentences are short and without any overly difficult words.
           Many working English learners will relate to it as it explains the absurdities (silly moments) of modern office life and how so little of it makes sense.
           What Is Great About It: Modern workplaces often feel like theaters where we pretend to work rather than get actual work done. 
           The speaker exposes this reality that nobody will ever admit to.
           He over-explains everything from the view out the office window to the intimate details of everyone’s life—from the overweight loner to the secret serial killer.
           It talks about the things that go unsaid; how people at the office know about the deep secrets of our home life, but do not talk about it.</h3>
